Pillars of Potential: A Prescription for Success
==========================================
#### *Market research on potential partnerships for an early-stage life-science company* 

<br/>

1. Conduct market research on potential partnerships for a specific EU- or US-based early-stage life-science company, by picking one of the companies from the list provided below for this evaluation.

- **Entac Medical** (US Based): https://entacmedical.com/
- **Alma** (EU Based): https://alma-medical.com/en/
- **Cambium** (US Based):  https://www.cambiumbio.com/
- **Histocell** (EU Based):  http://histocell.com/en/  
<br/>

>***I chose *Entac Medical* due to their pioneering work in digital health and advanced AI to predict patient adverse events. Their focus on proactive risk mitigation, continuous monitoring, and reducing hospital readmissions showcases their potential to transform patient care through cutting-edge technologies.***

<br/>

When you pick 1 company from the list above, you should further find 5 potentially good US Partners for the European Company OR good European Partners for the US based company (depending on which company you’ve picked).

Please make sure that identified potential partners meet a set of criteria in terms of development stage, funding they have garnered, life sciences segment, management team.

Create a Google Spreadsheet table that includes each potential partner’s company’s name, URL (preferably on LinkedIn), location, and the name(s) and contact information of the founder(s) or CEO. Please prioritize the companies in order of best fit with the target company.
